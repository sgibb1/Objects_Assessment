# Objects_Assessment

In this programming exercise you will be practicing DOM manipulation with objects.

Your finished product should be a Github URL with one HTML and one JavaScript file inside it (One per group, collaborate on the assignment).

In this activity you should only have a header and an empty <ol> tag in your HTML body. All of the other HTML on your page should be created with JavaScript.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Make a header in your HTML that says "My Top Five Favorite Movies"
Make an empty <ol> in your HTML.
Make an array of five objects that represent your top 5 favorite movies
Each object will be a movie should have a name key, a year key, a director key, and a picture key that has a URL of a poster (find pics on google)
Map over the array and build an array of <li> elements for each object (take a look at the last module video)
Grab the <ol> on the page with JavaScript and insert your array onto the page to display your top five favorite movies.
